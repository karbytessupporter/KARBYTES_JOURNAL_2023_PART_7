<p><span style="background: #ffff00">For approximately $70, I purchased a red tent from Target which has approximately twice the volume capacity as my old tent did (and that old tent was stolen from me when I left it set up and unattended in the field where I am testing the new tent at the time of this writing). I also found two of my black thermal undergarments which do a fairly decent job of insulating me from cold temperatures. I bought the tent so that I could use it to go on camping trips and to have a relatively private and sheltered &#8220;container&#8221; in which to rest, use my laptop, and whatever else I might prefer to do indoors instead of outdoors.</span></p>
<p><span style="background: #ffff00">Also, I learned that I can order a new AC outlet camping battery (the same model which I ordered twice in the past but have since lost) from Amazon for approximately $100 and I can have that parcel delivered for me to pick up at the Safeway grocery store in Castro Valley at the Amazon lockers part of the store. I will probably place an order for two of those batteries next time I get a paycheck (since each of those batteries affords me approximately 3 hours of battery life while my laptop battery affords approximately 1.5 hours of battery life (which would give me a total of approximately 7 hours of battery life between sessions in which I charge all three of those devices to full capacity). Slowly but surely, I am saving up to be able to travel with nothing but a backpack, tent, weather-resistant clothes, my laptop, my smartphone, my wallet, and travel-sized accessories (and I intend to purchase a bicycle for approximately $700 so that I can travel long distances as cheaply, cleanly, and autonomously as possible). I will probably also rent a public storage unit to keep the stuff which I do not want to always carry on my person securely stored. I read that the CubeSmart self-storage facility near Warm Springs BART station on Osgood road has small (5 x 10 foot) units which cost approximately $70 per month to rent (and the access hours are from 6AM to 10PM daily).</span></p>
